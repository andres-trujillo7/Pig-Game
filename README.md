# Pig-Game

Hello! Welcome to Andres Trujillo's game of PIG!          

In this game you are to roll an imaginary die (1-6) and so long as you do not roll a 1, the number you roll is added to your points count.                 
Your end goal is to get up to 100 points. After each roll, you will have the option to HOLD and end your turn or keep rolling.                               
    System.out.println("*   This is high risk/high reward because you can get very close to 100 if you continue rolling, or lose EVERYTHING you've rolled that turn if you roll a 1.  
    
Oh, and also you are going to be playing against The Computer. So..... good luck!
